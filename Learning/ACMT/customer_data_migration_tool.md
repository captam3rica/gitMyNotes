# Data Migration for MacBook Pro with Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports

All MacBook Pro with Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports models contain Solid State Drives (SSDs) that are soldered to the logic board.

In situations where the logic board requires replacement but the SSD is still working, special tools and procedures allow a technician to transfer customer data to the SSD on the replacement logic board after it is installed in the customer's computer.


## Customer Data Migration (CDM) Tool

- When logic board fails, but SSD still functioning
- Used after logic board repair

**Tools**

- CDM Tool Kit (076-00236), which includes:
  - CDM Tool (661-05097)
  - CDM Tool flex cable (923-01127, 3-pack)
  - Power cord, 923-00672 (part number prefix will indicate country, i.e., CH923-00672 for China)
  - Power brick, 923-01129
  - USB-C to USB-C cable (this is a USB-C 3 cable and is the only data transfer cable that is supported for this process) (923-01131)
  - Logic board holder (923-01130)
- Torx T3 screwdriver (magnetized)
- Torx T5 screwdriver (magnetized)
- Black stick

## First Steps

1. Install the logic board(LB) stiffeners
2. Place the logic board that was removed from the computer into the LB holder.  

    Note: The CDM Tool connector is located on different areas of the logic board on MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016 and 2017, Four Thunderbolt 3 Ports) and MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2016 and 2017). The logic board holder is set up to accommodate both.

3. Remove the T3 screws from the CDM tool connector
4. Inspect the CDM tool connector on the LB. If any pins are ben or if the connector is damaged, then the data cannot be transferred.
5. Inspect the CDM tool flex cable to make sure there pins are not damaged. If damaged, replace the cable.
  - The CDM Tool flex cable must be replaced after it has been connected to the logic board 30 times, regardless of whether or not a data migration has taken place. Use the life cycle check sheet that can be downloaded from article SM267: Flex Cable Life Cycle Counter to keep track of the number of times the cable has been connected to the logic board. Once you have checked 30 boxes, replace the cable.
  - Be sure the repaired computer has a power adapter attached during this process.

## Data Migration

1. Connect the CDM flex cable to the CDM connector on the KBB LB. Secure the connector with the 2 T3 screws.
2. Connect the USB-C to the USB-C cable from the repair computer to the CDM tool.
3. Connect the power adapter to the CDM tool.
4. Power on repair computer
5. Open the Migration Assistant on the repaired computer and proceed with data migration.

## Troubleshooting

1. Check CDM tool flex cable connection. The CDM tool is always seated on the left side of the defective LB.
2. Verify that CDM tool power adapter is receiving and providing power, by observing that is green LED is on. Try another outlet or power adapter.
3. Verify that CDM tool has power, LED is on. If not, check the power adapter connection.
4. Replace USB-C cable with a KG cable of the same type.
5. Test another defective LB is available. If none are available, or if KGB also fails, move to step 6.
6. Replace CDM tool flex cable.
7. Replace CDM tool.

## Disconnecting the CDM

1. Disconnect the power source from the CDM tool.  
2. Disconnect the USB-C to USB-C from the CDM tool.
3. Remove 2 T3 screws from the CDM tool connector on the KBB LB.
4. Disconnect the CDM tool flex cable by pinching tabs and pulling straight up.
5. Reinstall CDM tool connector cowling and 2 T3 screws
6. Store the CDM tool in its box. Do not wrap the flex cable around the tool.

## Replacing the CDM Tool Flex Cable

1. Turn the CDM tool over and remove 2 T3 screws
2. Remove 2 T5 screws from flex cable
3. Disconnect flex cable with flat end of Penta-P tool (Perfect Pointy Plastic Prying Probe)  
4. Replace the flex cable with a new one (923-01127)
5. Reinstall cowling screws
6. Reinstall CDM tool screws
