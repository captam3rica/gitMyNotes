# Tools of the Trade: Security Analyst Skills for IoT, the Cloud, or Any Network

## Session Information

Tools of the Trade: Security Analyst Skills for IoT, the Cloud, or Any Network
9:45 AM - 10:45 AM, August 2 2017
JW Grand Ballroom 4 – Level 4

Unsecured IoT devices are creating havoc for organizations. The Washington DC surveillance camera hack, the CloudPets breach, and the now $1-billion dollar ransomware business. Enterprises have migrated to the Cloud, creating new cybersecurity challenges and vulnerabilities. We’ll discuss how security analytics tools can be used to find and combat vulnerabilities common to IoT, the Cloud, or any network. See how Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools are used to monitor devices in real-time to identify attacks and stop them as they occur.

This session is CEU-approved for A+, Network+, Security+, Cloud+, CSA+, and CASP recertification.
