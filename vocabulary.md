# Vocabulary

-   **transient**

    Last or working only for a short time. Impermanent.

-   **paginate**

    To indicate the sequence of pages in (a book, manuscript, etc.) by place numbers or other 
    character on each leaf. To divide an electronic document into pages, as for printing.

-   **Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP)** 

    Used by network devices for advertising their id, capabilities, and neighbors on the IEEE 802 
    local area network, principally wired Ethernet.  Formally referred to as Station and 
    Media Access Control Connectivity Discovery.

    LLDP performs functions similar to other 
    popular protocols such as Cisco Discovery Protocol, Foundry Discovery Protocol, Nortel
    Discovery Protocol, and Link Layer Topology Discovery. Data collected in the MIB (DB) can be 
    queried by SNMP.

-   **RealTime Linux Kernel Scheduler (rtkit)**

    A real-time system is one that provides guaranteed system response times for events and 
    transactions--that is, every operation is expected to be completed within a certain rigid time 
    period. A system is classified as hard real-time if missed deadlines cause system failure and so
    ft real-time if the system can tolerate some missed time constraints.

-   **socket**: 

    **Unix Domain Socket**

    An inter-process communication socket is a data communications endpoint for 
    exchanging data between processes executing on the same host operating system. 

    Unix domain sockets use the file system as their address name space.
    Processes reference Unix domain sockets as file system nodes, so two
    processes can communicate by opening the same socket

    In addition, processes may send file descriptors across a Unix domain socket
    connection using the `sendmsg()` and `recmsg()` system calls. This allows a
    receiving process to get access to a descriptor that it would otherwise not
    be able to access.
