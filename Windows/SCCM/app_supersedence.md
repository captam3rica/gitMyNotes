# App Supersedence

- If previous version is listed as required, it may re-install.
- Can select to "Uninstall" previous app version before installing the new one.
- Sometimes, if "Uninstall" is not select, the app may upgrade itself anyway.
- Supersedence can still work even if the app v1 was not deployed by SCCM as long as the proper detection methods are in place.
