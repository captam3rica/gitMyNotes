## Battery Safety

**Important**

- Batteries must be handled with utmost care.
- All work space must be free of foreign or sharp material and batteries should not be exposed to heat or open flame.
- Do not drop, stack, puncture, crush, flex or apply unnecessary pressure to a battery, as this may result in damage.
- Damage to a battery may result in a potential fire hazard.

**Best Practice**

The battery contains several soft battery cells. Do not press on the battery cells with your fingers, and do not handle the battery pack in any way that might apply any physical pressure to these cells.

- Handle the covered battery by its edges only, with two hands at all times.
- Keep the battery cover on the battery at all times when the battery is out of the computer.
- Only remove the battery cover just before replacing the computer’s bottom case. Keep the battery cover on the battery at all other times.
- Do not drop a loose battery. If the battery is dropped, replace the battery.
- Only tighten the battery’s screws finger tight; do not overtighten them by any amount, or irreparable damage to the battery pack can result.
- Do not twist or torque the battery, or irreparable damage to the battery can result.

## Service Considerations

### Power-On Pads

If troubleshooting requires a need to start up the computer using the power-on pads, follow these steps:

1. To test startup on battery power, remove the bottom case only, and go to step 3.
2. To test startup using the power adapter, remove the bottom case and disconnect the battery cable to force the logic board to use the power adapter only.
3. Visually locate power-on pads next to IPD flex cable connector.
4. Using a jeweler's flat-blade screwdriver, touch power-on pads to power on logic board.
5. Listen for startup sound and/or fan operation to confirm power turns on.
