# Working with Profiles

## Steps

1. Have a package install the profile somewhere on the computer
2. Run the command `/usr/bin/profiles` (as root) in a postinstall script to install the profile

### Notes

- Can install the profile using something like AutoDMG
- The Profiles command will not be available so we need to install it to a special place that Mac OS will look at on boot: /private/var/db/ConfigurationProfiles/Setup
- We will need to clear the .profileSetupDone file if it exists due to the volume being booted in the past.
- An important distinction here is to set the package to use the full path starting with /private/var rather than simply /var, which is actually a symlink. It's been reported to have caused issues in some cases before, and it's simply not correct: install files to real paths rather than symlinks whenever possible.

- DO check that your package works from the command line with the following conditions: when a user is logged in, when no-one is logged in, and when installing to a non-boot volume.
- Don't require reboots when reloading a service or driver can accomplish the same outcome.
- Do not use an "Application First Run" script that requires administrator privileges to correctly setup the Application.
- Don't use post-install scripts to create or modify files â€“ do this in the package payload.
- Do exit a script with 0 on success, or a non-zero number if there are errors.
- Do provide an uninstaller or uninstall script.
- Do keep your config data and cache data separate.

Nameing Conventions

- Do list your vendor and product name in your package name.
- Do give packages meaningful names with version numbers.

## createOSXInstallPkg

- sudo ./createOSXinstallPkg --source /path/to/Install\ Mac\ OS\ X\ Lion.app --pkg /path/to/LocalAdmin.pkg --pkg /path/to/DisableSetupAssistant.pkg
  - You can add packages that you would like to install of the OS has completed its install process.
- --identifier 'com.example.installosx.pkg' will allow you to change the ID of the package. By default, the id is com.googlecode.munki.installosx.pkg
- If you have an existing flat component pkg, you can convert it into a distribution pkg: `productbuild --package /path/to/component.pkg /path/to/distribution.pkg`

### Installer Choice Changes

You'll find a MacOSXInstaller.choiceChanges file at InstallOSX.pkg/Contents/Resources/OS X Install Data/MacOSXInstaller.choiceChanges

See man installer for more info on ChoiceChangesXML files.

## makeProfilePkg

- Location: /private/var/db/ConfigurationProfiles/Setup

### Munki Specific

- As of Munki 2.2, Munki can natively import configuration profiles.

## Pushing Profile Settings with Munki Profile support

- Watch to see which plists change when modifying or launching an app after changes have been made.

### Creating the Profile

- Controling the preference files in these locations `~/Library/Preferences or /Library/Preferences` using Configuration Profiles.
- Convert regular preference files to configuration files by using the following script:

      ./mcxToProfile.py --plist ~/Library/Preferences
      com.fetchsoftworks.Fetch.License.plist
      --identifier FetchLicense --manage Once

  - --managed Once sets the setting one time then after that it does not enforce the setting allowing the user to change if needed.
  - --Often - settings the preference every login
  - if `--manage` is not set, the setting is enforced on every login and the user cannot change the setting.
- PayloadDisplayName: can also use `--displayname` during creation
- PayloadOrganization: can also use `--organization` during creation
- PayloadDescription

### Testing the Profile

- Use `defaults delete` to delete any preference files related to the profile being created just encase `cfprefsd` is still caching values.
- Double-click the `.mobileconfig` file to install the profile on the system.

### Importing Into Munki

- `munkiimport [profilename.mobileconfig]`
- Add the `--update-for [application]` if you want to the profile to be invoke everytime the software is installed.
- Import an already existing MCX Preference defined in an available Directory Services computer object.

      ./mcxToProfile.py --dsobject
      /LDAPv3/od.my.org/ComputerGroups/StandardPreferences --identifier
      MyBasePreferences

## StartOSInstall Command

- startosinstall lives in the Contents/Resources directory in the "Install OS X.app" bundle along with other familiar CLI tools.
- EULA stuff can be automated by 1) passing the requested 'A' character to the process via stdin (i.e. echo 'A' | startosinstall ...), or 2) running the tool using the undocumented --nointeraction flag.
- /var/log/install.log for install progress information
- sudo ./createOSXinstallPkg --plist /path/to/xml.plist allows for saving of package ingredients and recipe into a plist file for use later.
