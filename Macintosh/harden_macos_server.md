  - App Store
- CUPS configuration: https://cisofy.com/controls/PRNT-2307/
  - Change permissions on /etc/cups/cupsd.conf (chmod 740)

  - SCEP?

## Firewall

- Retrieve statistics
- Force VNC and ARD to use SSH tunnels

### PF
- pf replaces ipfw
- Block spoofed packets
- Core Compoents
  - /etc/pf.anchors/com.apple (rules placed here)
  - /etc/pf.conf (rules referenced here)
  - /etc/pf.os
- pf uses "anchors" - Dynamic includes that can contain rules, options, tables, and even other anchors
- /sbin/pfctl to control pc

      # Allow all local loopback
      set skip on lo)

      #Normalize and defragment
      scrub in all

      # Default deny policy
      block in all

      # Allow SSH from remote
      pass in quick inet proto tcp from any to any port 22

      # AFP over TCP
      pass in quick inet proto tcp from 192.168.0.0/16 to any port 548

      # Allow all outbound
      pass out all keep state

- Create a LaunchDaemon so that pf will start reliably

Testing Rules

- pfctl -n -g -f /path/to/profile
- -n just parses rules. It doesn't load them
- -g provides extra debugging
- -f file input
- -s show rules
- -d will disable pfctl
- -e enable
- sudo pfctl -s rules
- sudo pfctl -s all
