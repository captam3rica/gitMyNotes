# Personal Microsoft Accounts

**Potential Risk**  
While this kind of synchronization may be useful for consumers, it could
introduce risks for organizations, potentially allowing users to sync settings
and app data between corporate-owned or -managed PCs to personal devices, which
could lead to data leakage or a security breach. An account linked to a
Microsoft identity is also required to download and purchase apps from the
Windows Store, although it is possible to disable access to the store
independently from restricting the ability to link domain accounts to Microsoft
identities.
