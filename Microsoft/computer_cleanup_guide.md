# PC Computer Cleanup Guide

**Disclaimer** - By not means is the following an extensive list. This is just a good place to start.


1. Download **CCleaner** from (piriform.com/ccleaner)

  - There is a really good how-to guide on piriform's web site [here](https://www.piriform.com/docs/ccleaner/using-ccleaner)
  - Start with the **Clean your PC** section. This should clean most things slowing down the computer.

2. Check **Programs and Features**

  - Press the *Windows Key*
  - Begin typing the word **Control Panel**
  - From the *Control Panel* window, Select **Programs and Features**
  - Look through the list to see if there are any unnecessary programs installed on the computer ...
    - For example
      - **Nortan Anti Virus**
      - Software that comes preinstalled with the computer, such as Dell printer helper tool

3. Check to see which programs are set to start up automatically when logging in to the computer.

  - Right-click on the **Tool bar** at the bottom of the desktop.
  - Select **Task Manager**
  - From the *Task Manager* window, click on the **Start-up** tab
  - Select any program that does not need to start at logon then select the **Disable** button at the bottom right of the *Task Manager* window.
  - Repeat for additional applications
